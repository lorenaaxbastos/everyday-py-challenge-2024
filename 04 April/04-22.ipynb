    "# Most frequently used words in a text\n",

    "From: Codewars.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.\n",
    "- Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word ('abc, abc', 'abc', ab'c are all valid)\n",
    "- Any other characters (e.g. #, \\, / , . ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.\n",
    "- Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.\n",
    "- Ties may be broken arbitrarily.\n",
    "- If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to\n",
    "mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance\n",
    "in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for\n",
    "coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\n",
    "nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra\n",
    "on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "--> [\"a\", \"of\", \"on\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "\"e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e\"\n",
    "\n",
    "--> [\"e\", \"ddd\", \"aa\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "\"  //wont won't won't\"\n",
    "\n",
    "--> [\"won't\", \"wont\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus points (not really, but just for fun):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text.\n",
    "- Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.\n",
