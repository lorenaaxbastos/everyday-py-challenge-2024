    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in! Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, you can use my [my scientist birthday JSON file](https://www.practicepython.org/assets/scientist_birthdays.json). Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution) and draw your histogram.\n",
