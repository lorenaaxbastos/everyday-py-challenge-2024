    "- Instead of using the .txt file from above, [take this .txt file](https://www.practicepython.org/assets/Training_01.txt), and count how many of each “category” of each image there are. This text file is actually a list of files corresponding to the SUN database scene recognition database, and lists the file directory hierarchy for the images. Once you take a look at the first line or two of the file, it will be clear which part represents the scene category. \n",
