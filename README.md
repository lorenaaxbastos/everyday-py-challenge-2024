# Practicing Python everyday (2024)

I created this repo to make myself accountable and practice coding in Python everyday. It contains exercises from many different sources, including:

- Codewars
- HackerRank
- LeetCode
- Practice Python
- BeeCrowd

and many other...

Some of them may come from courses and bootcamps I'm enrolled as well.

## Wanna try this for yourself?

Fork this repo and make your self accountable too! Try solving the exercises and come up with different solutions if you want.

## My hopes

I expect to be solving more complex problems by the end of this year (2024) and build self discipline with this chellenge.
